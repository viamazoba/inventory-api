## Overview :writing_hand:

The application is a product inventory management system that utilizes CRUD operations to manage products. It allows users to create, edit, update, and delete products. The application consists of a backend and frontend, and this repository contains the backend structure.
This is the link of the frontend repository: [Frontend Project](https://github.com/erickfabiandev/CrudProject-React-Express) , and the link of the application deployed in vercel: [Deployed Project](https://crud-project-react-express.vercel.app/)

### Installation :gear:

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/viamazoba/inventory-api.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd inventory-api
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```shell
 npm install
```

4. Start the application:

```shell
 npm run dev
```

### The Challenge :weight_lifting_man:

The main challenge of this project is to develop a web application that allows efficient management of products. The key functionalities include:

- Add products: Use the form to add new products to the database via the backend API.
- Edit products: Modify the information of existing products using the form and update the changes via the API.
- Delete products: Remove products from the database via the API with a single click.
- View products: The table displays the registered products obtained from the API in a clear and organized manner.

## My Process :mountain:

### Built With :hammer_and_wrench:

The project was built with the following technologies and tools:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Nodemon
- Cors

### What I Learned :microscope:

During the development of this project, I gained experience in:

- Utilizing React to create reusable components and manage the application state.
- Applying custom styles using Sass to enhance the visual appearance.
- Consuming an Express backend API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.

### Continued Development :briefcase:

In future development, I plan to enhance the project by adding additional features, such as authentication and authorization for user access, pagination and filtering options for the product list, and error handling.
